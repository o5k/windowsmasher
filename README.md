# WindowSmasher
### Window manager tool
It's Fancy Zones, but with less ease-of-use and more keyboard.

---

# Usage

1. Get yourself the .NET framework 2.0 or up (Hint: You probably already have this)
2. Set up `zones.txt` (run the program once, it'll make a `zones.txt` next to itself, then edit it to your liking)
3. Restart it (kill it in Task Manager then run it again)
4. Use the following keybinds:
	- **Windows + NumpadPeriod** to show all zones for your current preset
	- **Windows + NumpadEnter** to attach the currently active window to the zone your cursor is pointing to
	- **Windows + Numpad0 - Numpad9** to change preset
